  Problem Statement

  Use the Pokemon API to build pokedex.  Pokedex is a directory/display system to view pokemons.  Display 20 pokemons at a time in a tabular/list display.  The display will contain at a minimum the name and the image of the pokemon. You can implement infinite scrolling or pagination.  If using pagination, display 2 buttons at the end of the page for ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’.  Clicking on each will display either the next or previous set of pokemons.

  Clicking on a pokemon will bring up a display card from the side with details.  The Pokemon detail will include the name, image, weight and ability.
